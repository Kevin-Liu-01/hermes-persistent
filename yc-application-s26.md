# YC S26 Application — Agent Machines

---

## Bay Area Landscape Analysis (May 2026)

### The stack that's crystallizing

The Bay is building layers. Nobody has built the combined primitive:

| What people are building | Players | The problem |
|---|---|---|
| **Containers** (bare compute) | E2B, Modal, Fly, Dedalus | Nobody wants a bare container. |
| **Frameworks** (agent logic) | LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenClaw | Logic without a persistent home. |
| **Memory** (bolt-on state) | Mem0 ($24M), Letta ($10M) | Band-aid on stateless models. |
| **Models** (raw intelligence) | OpenAI, Anthropic, Google | Commodity. Falling prices. |

Everyone treats containers and agents as separate things — a container you put an agent into, or an agent you give a sandbox to. **The actual primitive people want is the persistent agent-on-a-machine.** Not a bare VM. Not a stateless framework. The combined unit: an agent with a home, skills, services, memory, and scheduling — ready to work.

Agent Machines ships that combined primitive. And the reason people care about containers at all in this context is to run persistent agents — so we're the layer that gives the container market its primary use case.

The parallel: before ChatGPT, you needed API keys and Python to use GPT-3. OpenAI didn't invent the model — they invented the interface. Same here. Containers exist. Frameworks exist. But the combined "deploy a persistent agent" primitive with an accessible interface? Missing.

### The two audiences — and the programmatic endgame

**Audience 1: Humans** — Today's agent tools (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenClaw CLI) are expert-only. Terminals, SSH, MCP configs. 95% of people who want persistent agents working for them aren't sysadmins. They need a visual interface: provision from a template, watch it work, drop in customizations. That's our dashboard.

**Audience 2: Other agents** — This is the endgame. An MCP server and CLI that lets a head agent programmatically spin up, coordinate, and tear down specialized agent machines. One orchestrator agent managing a fleet: "spin up a code review agent, a research agent, and a deploy agent — route this task across all three." The interface serves humans first, then becomes the API surface for agent-to-agent coordination.

This is what makes the combined primitive powerful: when agents can provision other agents via MCP, the platform becomes self-scaling. Every agent machine is both a worker and a potential orchestrator.

**The enterprise gap is also real**: ServiceNow, Microsoft Foundry, and Guild.ai published "agent control plane" strategies in 2026. But they're building for enterprises with 18-month sales cycles. We start with developers and their agents today, grow into teams, then enterprise. Bottom-up, like Datadog and Vercel.

### Why the combined primitive wins

Individual layers (bare VMs, memory stores, frameworks) are commodity. The combined "persistent agent" primitive is not:

- A bare container has no value until an agent lives on it. We are the reason people buy containers.
- Memory is one feature of a persistent agent, not a product. Mem0's moat disappears when the agent has a real filesystem.
- Frameworks define logic but don't deploy, persist, observe, or schedule anything. We do all of that.

**The primitive is agent+machine, not machine alone.** We package the full unit: runtime, skills, services, scheduling, observation — on any substrate. The interface to deploy, watch, and customize that unit is where all value accrues.

### What makes this defensible

1. **The skill protocol (SKILL.md)** — a structured, versioned format where every complex task becomes a reusable agent procedure. 155 ship pre-loaded. Compounds with every session. No one else has a protocol for agents to learn, share, and version procedures. This is npm for agent intelligence.

2. **The combined harness** — 155 skills, 17 MCP integrations, browser automation, Cursor delegation, cron scheduling, health monitoring. 6 months of battle-tested agent tooling that deploys as a single unit in 30 seconds. The harness IS the product — the container is just where it runs.

3. **The observation layer** — session playback, skill invocation tracking, cost attribution, log correlation. You can't orchestrate what you can't see. This is what makes us the interface, not just another CLI. Same stickiness as Datadog.

4. **The MCP/CLI surface for programmatic control** — our interface isn't just a dashboard for humans. It's an MCP server and CLI that agents themselves can call. A head agent provisions specialized machines, routes tasks, tears down workers — programmatically. This makes the platform self-scaling: agents are both consumers and orchestrators of other agents.

### What is your company going to make?

Agent Machines deploys persistent agents as a single combined primitive — an agent with a home, skills, services, memory, scheduling, and observability — on any container substrate. The interface lets you provision, watch, and customize these agents without understanding the underlying infrastructure.

Right now the Bay is building every layer separately: containers (E2B, Modal, Fly, Dedalus), frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, OpenClaw), memory (Mem0, Letta), models (OpenAI, Anthropic). Everyone treats containers and agents as separate things — a container you put an agent into, or an agent you give a sandbox to. **The actual primitive people want is the persistent agent-on-a-machine.** Nobody wants a raw VM. The entire interest in containers/microVMs is to run persistent agents — so we're the layer that gives the container market its primary use case. We ship that combined unit directly, instead of making you assemble an agent from a VM + a framework + a memory provider + tool configs + cron + MCP servers.

**How it started**: I built this at Dedalus Labs to dogfood and benchmark our own microVMs against E2B, Fly, and Modal. I needed to deploy agents across substrates, observe what they were doing, and compare. The observation layer became more valuable than the benchmarking. Once I could see agents working in real-time, I wanted to control them: schedule work, manage lifecycle, insert new skills. The benchmarking tool became an observation layer, then an orchestration layer, then the full interface.

**What we ship today:**

- **The combined primitive**: Deploy a persistent agent in 30 seconds. Runtime, 155 skills, 17 service integrations, browser automation, Cursor delegation, cron scheduling — one unit, any substrate. Not a bare container you build on top of.
- **Visual observation**: Watch agents work in real-time through the dashboard. Sessions, tool calls, skill invocations, cost — all visible without SSH or log-tailing.
- **Opinionated templates + insertion layers**: Works out of the box. But every layer is customizable — drop in skills (SKILL.md protocol), connect services (MCP), set governance, change substrate.
- **Skill accumulation**: Every complex task becomes a reusable procedure. After 6 months, hundreds of custom skills. New users inherit the community library (155 today, growing).
- **Programmatic control (the endgame)**: An MCP server and CLI so agents themselves can provision and coordinate other agent machines. One head agent spins up a fleet of specialized workers, routes tasks, observes results, tears down idle machines. The interface serves humans today — and becomes the API for agent-to-agent orchestration.

We serve two audiences. **Humans first**: today's agent tools (Cursor, Claude Code, OpenClaw CLI) are expert-only — terminals, SSH, MCP configs. 95% of people who want persistent agents aren't sysadmins. We're the accessible interface. **Other agents second (the endgame)**: an MCP server and CLI so a head agent can programmatically spin up, coordinate, and tear down specialized agent machines — one orchestrator managing a fleet. When agents can provision other agents, the platform self-scales.

The enterprise gap is real too: ServiceNow, Microsoft Foundry, and Guild.ai published "agent control plane" strategies in 2026, but they're building for 18-month enterprise sales cycles. We start with developers and their agents today, grow into teams, then enterprise. Bottom-up, like Datadog and Vercel.

### Where do you live now, and where would the company be based after YC?

San Francisco, USA / San Francisco, USA

### Explain your decision regarding location

I'm a Princeton sophomore graduating early — one of two in my class. I chose to spend 2026 in SF rather than on campus. After 6 months here, I've learned more than I did in 1.5 years at Princeton. I'm forward-deployed at Dedalus Labs, embedded in the agent infrastructure ecosystem, shipping product alongside the substrate providers and developers who are our customers. I will learn and build more and faster here than anywhere else. The company stays in SF.

### How far along are you?

Live product at agent-machines.dev with real users. Full control plane operational:
- CLI that deploys a fully-harnessed agent in 30 seconds (`npm run deploy`)
- Web dashboard: multi-machine management, chat, skills browser, session viewer, log tail, artifacts, usage tracking
- 155 production-tested skills in the protocol
- 17 MCP service integrations live
- Cursor IDE delegation via MCP bridge
- Cron-scheduled autonomous operation (agents run without human prompts)
- Dedalus microVMs as first substrate provider, with Fly and Vercel Sandbox architecturally ready
- Open source on GitHub

### How long have each of you been working on this? How much of that has been full-time?

~3 months on Agent Machines directly, full-time alongside my work at Dedalus Labs. Built on top of 6 months of forward-deployed startup experience at Dedalus (where I own multiple domains and learned distribution/GTM firsthand), plus prior work on agent harnesses at AWS and the Hermes runtime.

### What tech stack are you using?

**Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, Clerk auth, React Three Fiber for 3D visualizations
**Backend/CLI**: Node.js + tsx, Dedalus SDK for machine provisioning
**Agent Runtime**: Hermes (default) or OpenClaw — both run on the microVM
**Infrastructure**: Dedalus Machines (microVMs with persistent state, 250ms boot, sleep/wake, VM-level isolation)
**AI Models**: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (default), routable to 200+ models via Dedalus inference API (OpenAI-compatible)
**AI Coding Tools**: Cursor (via @cursor/sdk MCP bridge), Claude Code, Codex
**MCP Services**: Vercel, Stripe, Supabase, GitHub, Linear, Slack, Figma, PostHog, Sentry, Datadog, Firebase, Shopify, ClickHouse, Cloudflare, AWS

### Are people using your product?
Yes

### Do you have revenue?
No

### Why did you pick this idea to work on? Do you have domain expertise?

For the past 6 months I've been forward-deployed at Dedalus Labs — wearing every hat, owning multiple domains, learning how a startup actually ships, distributes, and grows. The biggest lesson: it's a distribution game. The best infrastructure doesn't win. The infrastructure people can understand and adopt wins.

That's why I built Agent Machines. It started as a tool to dogfood and benchmark our own microVMs against E2B, Fly, Modal. The observation layer I built to watch agents became more valuable than the benchmarks. Observation became orchestration. But the real insight was about distribution: Agent Machines fills an **observability and imagination gap**. It's hard to imagine what you can do with a bare sandbox — the use case is abstract. But a persistent agent with skills, services, and scheduling? People get it immediately. And because we're simultaneously low-level (real VMs, real tools) and high-level (visual dashboard, templates), we give actual observability instead of a black box. We'll win on distribution because the product explains itself.

Domain expertise is vertically integrated:
- Forward-deployed at Dedalus Labs for 6 months (the microVM substrate — I know the infrastructure, the distribution, and the GTM from the inside)
- Built Hermes (the agent runtime that executes inside machines)
- Authored 155 production-tested skills in the SKILL.md protocol
- Built MCP integrations for 17 services
- Operated persistent agents with autonomous cron for months
- Benchmarked agents across every major container/VM provider

The name is the primitive: the simple solution that solves your problem.

### Who are your competitors? What do you understand that they don't?

Everyone in the Bay is building one layer. Nobody has built the combined primitive. Our competitors are all in different layers — and we subsume or sit on top of each:

**Container/VM providers** (sell raw compute — we give it a reason to exist):
- **E2B / Modal / Fly.io / Dedalus** — Sell bare containers. But nobody wants a bare container — they want the persistent agent that lives on it. We are the primary use case for their product. We use them as substrate, like Vercel uses AWS.

**Memory bolt-ons** (one feature of the combined primitive):
- **Mem0** ($24M raised) / **Letta** ($10M) — Bolt memory onto stateless agents. But memory is one file on a filesystem. When you ship the full primitive (agent + machine + skills + services), memory is a trivial included feature, not a separate product.

**Agent frameworks** (logic without a home):
- **LangGraph / CrewAI / OpenClaw** — Define agent logic. Don't deploy it, persist it, observe it, or schedule it. We're the deploy-and-manage layer that makes frameworks useful in production.

**Expert-only agent tools** (powerful, narrow audience):
- **Cursor / Claude Code / OpenClaw CLI** — Excellent for terminal experts. But they require SSH, MCP configs, manual process management. No visual interface. No templates. No observation. And critically: no programmatic MCP for agent-to-agent coordination. They're single-agent tools, not fleet orchestrators.

**What I understand that they don't:**

1. **The primitive is agent+container, not container alone.** Everyone in the Bay is building containers OR agents OR memory as separate products. The thing people actually want is the combined unit: a persistent agent with skills, services, memory, and scheduling — ready to work. The name is the primitive: the simple solution that solves your problem. (Also — it wasn't taken.)

2. **Distribution wins on imagination, not specs.** It's hard to imagine what you can do with a bare sandbox — the use case is abstract. But a persistent agent that runs security audits, deploys your code, monitors your services, and gets smarter every week? People get it immediately. We win on distribution because the product explains itself. Competitors sell infrastructure. We sell the outcome.

3. **Observation beats the black box.** I discovered this building the tool: you can't orchestrate what you can't see. Because we're simultaneously low-level (real VMs, real tool calls) and high-level (visual dashboard, templates), we give actual observability instead of a black box. Competitors skip to "run code" without showing what's happening. That's why they stay expert-only.

4. **The programmatic surface is the real moat.** A dashboard for humans is table stakes. An MCP server that lets agents provision and coordinate other agents — that's the endgame. When your platform is callable by agents, not just humans, growth becomes recursive. No competitor is building this.

### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

**Revenue model**: Platform fee + compute margin (we mark up substrate costs like Vercel marks up AWS).

**Tiers**:
- Free: 1 machine, 10 compute-hours/mo, community skill library
- Pro ($29/mo): 5 machines, unlimited compute, full skill library, cron scheduling, priority routing
- Team ($99/seat/mo): Fleet management, shared skill libraries, audit logs, SSO, team governance
- Enterprise (custom): Self-hosted option, compliance layer, private skill registries, SLA

**Why this grows fast**: Every skill an agent learns generates more autonomous work (cron jobs, scheduled audits, automated deploys). More autonomous work = more compute hours = more revenue. Usage compounds without the developer doing anything. This is the AWS flywheel: the more you use it, the more you need it.

**TAM**: Agent infrastructure market projected $47B+ by 2028 (44% CAGR). Control planes in adjacent markets capture 10-30% of total spend (Kubernetes ecosystem is ~$7B of $65B container market). If agent compute reaches $47B, the control plane layer is $5-15B.

**Near-term**: 100K developers × $29/mo = $35M ARR. Plausible within 3 years given 57% of teams already run agents and have no management layer.

**Expansion**: The skill marketplace takes a cut of premium skill sales (like Shopify themes). Enterprise governance is high-margin SaaS. Substrate cost optimization (routing to cheapest provider) creates a Cloudflare-style margin expansion over time.

### Other ideas considered

1. **Agent skill marketplace** (standalone) — Publishing and monetizing SKILL.md files. Realized this is a feature, not a company. Skills need an execution environment to have value.
2. **AI-native CI/CD** — Agent-driven pipelines replacing GitHub Actions. The combined primitive subsumes this: cron + skills + substrate management IS CI/CD for agents.
3. **Agent-to-agent protocol** (standalone) — A networking standard for agents. Too early as a spec. But the Agent Machines MCP server IS this protocol in practice — the programmatic surface for agents to provision and coordinate other agents. Shipping it as infrastructure rather than a standard is the right path.

## Moat & Future Plans

### Why the combined primitive is defensible (and bare VMs aren't)

Containers are commodity. Anyone can spin up a microVM. But the combined "persistent agent" unit — with skills, services, observation, and scheduling — is not. And the programmatic MCP surface that lets agents orchestrate other agents? That's where lock-in compounds.

1. **Intelligence lock-in via the skill protocol.** SKILL.md is a structured format for agent-learned procedures. Every complex task becomes a reusable skill. After 6 months: hundreds of procedures customized to your stack, conventions, services. Not portable to ChatGPT, Claude, or any single-vendor agent. Switching costs grow with every session.

2. **The skill graph has network effects.** 155 skills ship today. As the community grows, the shared library grows. New users in 2027 start with 1000+ battle-tested procedures. This is npm for agent intelligence — the registry gets more valuable with every contributor.

3. **Substrate abstraction accrues value at our layer.** We make container providers interchangeable. Today Dedalus, tomorrow Fly, Vercel, self-hosted. The combined primitive deploys identically on any substrate. The value stays in our layer regardless of where the bits run.

4. **The programmatic surface creates recursive growth.** When a head agent can provision worker agents via MCP, every agent machine is both a consumer and a creator of demand. Growth becomes self-reinforcing — agents scale the platform faster than humans alone ever could.

### Future roadmap

**Q3 2026 — Multi-substrate + billing + marketplace**:
- Fly.io and Vercel Sandbox as live substrate options (architecturally ready today)
- Usage-based billing: pay per active compute-hour, store-only when sleeping
- Skill marketplace: publish, install, rate, version community skills

**Q4 2026 — The programmatic layer (the big unlock)**:
- **Agent Machines MCP server**: an MCP tool that any agent can call to provision, wake, sleep, destroy, and chat with other agent machines. This turns every existing agent (Claude, Cursor, OpenClaw, custom) into an orchestrator of our platform.
- **Agent Machines CLI**: same operations from any terminal or CI pipeline — `am provision --template code-review`, `am fleet create`, `am route task`
- Head-agent pattern: one orchestrator agent manages a fleet of specialized workers, routing tasks by capability, observing results, scaling up/down

**2027 — Self-scaling agent fleets**:
- Team/org fleet management with shared skill libraries and governance
- Agent-to-agent task routing: specialized machines advertise capabilities, head agents discover and delegate
- Substrate cost optimizer: head agent routes workloads to cheapest provider automatically
- Enterprise compliance: audit trails, budget limits, model allowlists, data boundaries
- Self-hosting: run the full stack on your own infrastructure

### Why this scales — three phases

**Phase 1 (now): Humans deploy agents through the interface.**
Visual dashboard, templates, insertion layers. Makes persistent agents accessible to non-experts. This is the ChatGPT moment for agents.

**Phase 2 (Q4 2026): Agents deploy agents through MCP/CLI.**
The same platform, but the user is an agent, not a human. A head agent calls `agent-machines/provision` via MCP, spins up three workers, routes a complex task across them, observes results, tears down idle machines. The interface becomes an API. The platform becomes self-scaling.

**Phase 3 (2027): Agent fleets as a service.**
Organizations run fleets of specialized agents — code review, research, ops, compliance — all managed through our control plane. Head agents orchestrate. Humans set policies and observe. The platform is the nervous system.

### The endgame

```
Human or Head Agent
        ↓
Agent Machines (dashboard / MCP server / CLI)
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  Provision & Observe    Route & Schedule     Skill Registry
        ↓                    ↓                    ↓
  [persistent agent machines on any substrate]
        ↓
  Dedalus | Fly | Vercel | self-hosted | future
```

The critical insight: when agents can programmatically provision and coordinate other agents through our MCP, the platform self-scales. Every agent machine is both a worker AND a potential orchestrator. Growth becomes recursive — agents create demand for more agents.

Flywheels:
- Every new substrate → more routing options, better pricing
- Every new skill → better templates, faster onboarding, more capable agents
- Every new user (human OR agent) → more operational data, more community skills
- Every head agent that orchestrates → creates demand for N more worker machines

"I'm Kevin Liu. I'm 19. Princeton sophomore, one of two in my class 
graduating early. Chose to spend 2026 in SF instead of on campus. 
Ex-Bloomberg, ex-AWS. Building at Dedalus Labs."

[0:08 - 0:20]
"I have this pattern I call induced hurdles. My ambitions put me in 
front of the hardest problems I can find and I stay until I solve them. 
In college I cofounded OMMC, the largest online math competition for 
high schoolers. 35K in sponsorships. Thousands of students. I had to 
figure out scaling under load, harden the test portal against kids 
trying to break in, ship real product UI. First time I built something 
people actually depended on."

[0:20 - 0:32]
"At AWS I built my first agent harness. Custom Bedrock agent wired 
into my workflow because I was tired of copy-pasting docs. Ugly, but 
it worked. That was the seed. Then Dedalus. Six months forward-deployed, 
wearing every hat, owning multiple domains. I learned the thing that 
matters most: it's a distribution game. Best infrastructure loses to 
the infrastructure people can actually understand and adopt."

[0:32 - 0:48]
"Agent Machines came out of dogfooding Dedalus containers. I needed to

it's hard to imagine what you'd do with a bare sandbox. Abstract. But 
a persistent agent that audits your code, deploys your app, monitors

## Additional Application Fields

### Who writes code on your product?
Me. All technical work so far — CLI, web dashboard, skill protocol, MCP integrations, substrate provider abstraction, Hermes agent runtime.

### Are you looking for a cofounder?
Yes. I have two people I'd cofound with in a heartbeat — one from MIT, one from Columbia — both willing to drop out. We're in active conversations. Ideal profile: distributed systems / orchestration background (Kubernetes, Nomad, Terraform, cloud infrastructure). The product works today for individual developers; a cofounder helps make it work for fleets of thousands of agents.

### Applied before / pivot?
Yes. Applied previously with a different idea and cofounder (Athan Zhang). YC told us to figure out whether we wanted to drop out. We split — Athan founded Copperlane, which is in the current Spring batch. I stayed in SF and went forward-deployed at Dedalus Labs to learn how startups actually work from the inside.

Different idea, different cofounder, different company. Agent Machines emerged from 6 months of operating at Dedalus — dogfooding containers, building agent harnesses, learning distribution. The previous application was the push I needed to get serious. This time I'm applying with a live product, real users, and the conviction that comes from shipping.

### Incubator/accelerator participation?
[Fill if applicable]

### What convinced you to apply to YC?
YC's Summer 2026 RFS calls out "Software for Agents" and "Dynamic Software Interfaces." Agent Machines sits at the intersection — it's the dynamic interface through which a wide audience provisions, observes, and controls agent infrastructure. The timing is right: substrates just got cheap, frameworks just stabilized, and the interface layer is completely open. We're the ChatGPT moment for agents — the accessibility layer that opens a huge new audience. YC's network and pace match the land-grab urgency.
