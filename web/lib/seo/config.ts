export const FAQ: ReadonlyArray<FaqEntry> = [
	{
		question: "What is Agent Machines?",
		answer:
			"Agent Machines is a per-account runtime for persistent agents. Each signed-in user can keep machines with durable Linux filesystems under /home/machine, so chats, working files, artifacts, learned skills, and cron schedules survive sleep and wake cycles.",
	},
	{
		question: "How is this different from a regular chatbot?",
		answer:
			"A regular chatbot usually stores memory in browser state or a vendor-owned memory layer. Agent Machines persists operational state to a real machine filesystem: chat records, artifacts, USER.md, MEMORY.md, agent sessions, cron schedules, skills, and the runtime venv.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which agents can I run?",
		answer:
			"Hermes and OpenClaw are the two agent runtimes represented in the app. Hermes is the default memory, cron, sessions, and MCP-native runtime. OpenClaw is the computer-use runtime with browser, screenshot, click, shell, and file operations. Both sit behind the same machine/gateway concept.",
	},
	{
		question: "Which providers can host the machine?",
		answer:
			"Dedalus Machines is wired end-to-end today. The MachineProvider abstraction, setup UI, and user config schema also include Vercel Sandbox and Fly Machines, but those provisioners currently return explicit not-supported responses until their provider implementations land.",
	},
	{
		question: "How do I get my own machine today?",
		answer:
			"Sign in with Clerk, add provider credentials in /dashboard/setup, pick the agent, provider, spec, and model, then provision the machine record. The browser flow creates the provider machine and stores it in your fleet; the reliable agent bootstrap path is still the matching root CLI deploy command until browser-driven bootstrap lands.",
	},
	{
		question: "What tools and skills come pre-installed?",
		answer:
			"The public loadout tracks 23 built-in tools, 17 service routes, and 96 SKILL.md files. The surface includes terminal, filesystem, browser automation, web search, vision, image generation, code execution, cron, memory, sessions, closed-loop CLIs (agent-browser, Playwright, curl, jq, httpx, sqlite3, ss, dig), Vercel, Stripe, Supabase, Linear, GitHub, Slack, PostHog, Sentry, Clerk, Firebase, Figma, Shopify, ClickHouse, Datadog, AWS, Cloudflare, and model providers.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is Cursor required?",
		answer:
			"No. Cursor is optional delegation for code edits through cursor-bridge and @cursor/sdk. Without CURSOR_API_KEY, the rest of the machine still runs: chat, files, browser automation, closed-loop tools, skills, cron, memory, dashboard polling, artifacts, and provider lifecycle controls.",
	},
	{
		question: "What is ~/.agent-machines?",
		answer:
			"~/.agent-machines is the unified runtime root for Agent Machines. It holds all agent state -- skills, crons, sessions, logs, MEMORY.md, USER.md, config, chats, and artifacts. The repo checkout at /home/machine/agent-machines is used by reload-from-git.sh to sync knowledge from GitHub.",
	},
	{
		question: "What inference providers are supported?",
		answer:
			"Dedalus is the default OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint. The agent is configured through model.base_url and model.default, so the CLI can point DEDALUS_CHAT_BASE_URL at another compatible /v1 endpoint when needed. The dashboard stores a model slug per machine.",
	},
	{
		question: "What happens when a machine sleeps?",
		answer:
			"On supported providers, sleep pauses compute while preserving the persistent volume. The next wake resumes from disk: app artifacts, agent runtime state, skills, cron schedules, sessions, and the venv remain available.",
	},
	{
		question: "Where does my data live?",
		answer:
			"Provider credentials and gateway bearers live in Clerk private metadata. Machine state lives on the provider machine under /home/machine, with all agent runtime data and app state under ~/.agent-machines. The public client only sees redacted provider and machine status.",
	},
